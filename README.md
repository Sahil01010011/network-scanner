## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: Clone Repository (Recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sahil01010011/network-scanner.git
cd network-scanner
```

### Method 2: Download Source
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Sahil01010011/network-scanner/releases) and extract the files.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- [`scapy`](https://scapy.net/) - Packet manipulation library
- [`mac-vendor-lookup`](https://pypi.org/project/mac-vendor-lookup/) - MAC address vendor identification
- [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/) - HTTP library for vendor lookups
- [`psutil`](https://pyutil.readthedocs.io/) - System and process utilities

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
sudo python3 scanner.py
```

#### On Windows:
```cmd
# Run Command Prompt as Administrator
python scanner.py
```

### Advanced Usage Examples

#### Scanning Specific Network Range
```python
# Modify the script to scan a custom range
network_range = "192.168.1.0/24"  # Custom subnet
```

#### Custom Port Scanning
```python
# Add custom ports to scan
custom_ports = [21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 135, 139, 443, 445, 993, 995, 3389, 5432, 5900, 8080, 8443]
```

## üìä Sample Output

### Console Output
```
[*] Scanning the network: 192.168.1.0/24

[+] Detailed Device Scan Results:
IP Address      MAC Address          Vendor                        Open Ports          
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.1     aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff    NETGEAR                       22, 80, 443
192.168.1.15    11:22:33:44:55:66    Apple, Inc.                   22, 5900
192.168.1.25    ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa    Intel Corporate               None
192.168.1.100   ab:cd:ef:12:34:56    Raspberry Pi Foundation       22, 80

[+] Scan results saved to network_scan_results_20241214_143022.csv
```

### CSV Output
The generated CSV file contains structured data perfect for further analysis:
```csv
IP Address,MAC Address,Vendor,Open Ports
192.168.1.1,aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff,NETGEAR,"22, 80, 443"
192.168.1.15,11:22:33:44:55:66,"Apple, Inc.","22, 5900"
192.168.1.25,ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa,Intel Corporate,None
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Customizing Scan Parameters

You can modify the following parameters in `scanner.py`:

```python
# Modify timeout for faster/slower scans
sock.settimeout(0.5)  # Increase for slower networks

# Customize port list
common_ports = [21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 135, 139, 443, 445, 3389, 8080]

# Change network range detection
network_range = f"{'.'.join(local_ip.split('.')[:-1])}.0/24"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **"Permission denied" errors**
- **Linux/macOS**: Run with `sudo python3 scanner.py`
- **Windows**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator

#### **Module not found errors**
The script automatically installs missing dependencies. If manual installation is needed:
```bash
pip install scapy mac-vendor-lookup requests psutil
```

#### **No devices found**
- Ensure you're connected to a network
- Check if your firewall is blocking the scan
- Try running with administrator/root privileges
- Verify your network configuration

#### **Slow scanning**
- Adjust the timeout value in the `scan_ports()` function
- Reduce the port list for faster scans
- Check your network connection speed

#### **"Unknown" vendor results**
- Some MAC addresses may not be in the vendor database
- Private/locally administered MAC addresses will show as "Unknown"
- Ensure internet connectivity for vendor lookups

## üîí Security Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Usage
- **‚úÖ Authorized Use Only**: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test
- **‚úÖ Educational Purpose**: Ideal for learning network security concepts
- **‚úÖ Network Administration**: Perfect for IT professionals managing networks
- **‚ùå Unauthorized Scanning**: Do not scan networks without permission

### Best Practices
- Always obtain proper authorization before scanning
- Use responsibly and respect network policies
- Consider the impact on network performance
- Keep scan results confidential and secure
